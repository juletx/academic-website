abstract: XNLI is a popular Natural Language Inference (NLI) benchmark widely used
  to evaluate cross-lingual Natural Language Understanding (NLU) capabilities across
  languages. In this paper, we expand XNLI to include Basque, a low-resource language
  that can greatly benefit from transfer-learning approaches. The new dataset, dubbed
  XNLIeu, has been developed by first machine-translating the English XNLI corpus
  into Basque, followed by a manual post-edition step. We have conducted a series
  of experiments using mono- and multilingual LLMs to assess a) the effect of professional
  post-edition on the MT system; b) the best cross-lingual strategy for NLI in Basque;
  and c) whether the choice of the best cross-lingual strategy is influenced by the
  fact that the dataset is built by translation. The results show that post-edition
  is necessary and that the translate-train cross-lingual strategy obtains better
  results overall, although the gain is lower when tested in a dataset that has been
  built natively from scratch. Our code and datasets are publicly available under
  open licenses at https://github.com/hitz-zentroa/xnli-eu.
