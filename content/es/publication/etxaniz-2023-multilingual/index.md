abstract: Translate-test is a popular technique to improve the performance of multilingual
  language models. This approach works by translating the input into English using
  an external machine translation system, and running inference over the translated
  input. However, these improvements can be attributed to the use of a separate translation
  system, which is typically trained on large amounts of parallel data not seen by
  the language model. In this work, we introduce a new approach called self-translate,
  which overcomes the need of an external translation system by leveraging the few-shot
  translation capabilities of multilingual language models. Experiments over 5 tasks
  show that self-translate consistently outperforms direct inference, demonstrating
  that language models are unable to leverage their full multilingual potential when
  prompted in non-English languages. Our code is available at https://github.com/juletx/self-translate.
