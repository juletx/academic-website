abstract: The objective of the project is to build a system for the definition and
  implementation of software development processes based on metamodels. In fact, there
  are several methodologies that are suitable for software development. It is important
  to define the information of these methodologies through models so that they can
  be managed flexibly in the future and improvements can be made. In addition, it
  is necessary to build a system that establishes a methodology using information
  from the model for use by development teams in projects. The OpenUP methodology
  was used for the development of the project and the CCII-N2016-02 standard for the
  drafting of the project documentation and memory.
