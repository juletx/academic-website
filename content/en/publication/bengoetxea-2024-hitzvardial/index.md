abstract: 'In this paper we present our submission for the NorSID Shared Task as part
  of the 2025 VarDial Workshop (Scherrer et al., 2025), consisting of three tasks:
  Intent Detection, Slot Filling and Dialect Identification, evaluated using data
  in different dialects of the Norwegian language. For Intent Detection and Slot Filling,
  we have fine-tuned a multitask model in a cross-lingual setting, to leverage the
  xSID dataset available in 17 languages. In the case of Dialect Identification, our
  final submission consists of a model fine-tuned on the provided development set,
  which has obtained the highest scores within our experiments. Our final results
  on the test set show that our models do not drop in performance compared to the
  development set, likely due to the domain-specificity of the dataset and the similar
  distribution of both subsets. Finally, we also report an in-depth analysis of the
  provided datasets and their artifacts, as well as other sets of experiments that
  have been carried out but did not yield the best results. Additionally, we present
  an analysis on the reasons why some methods have been more successful than others;
  mainly the impact of the combination of languages and domain-specificity of the
  training data on the results.'
