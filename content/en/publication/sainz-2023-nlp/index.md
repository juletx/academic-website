abstract: In this position paper, we argue that the classical evaluation on Natural
  Language Processing (NLP) tasks using annotated benchmarks is in trouble. The worst
  kind of data contamination happens when a Large Language Model (LLM) is trained
  on the test split of a benchmark, and then evaluated in the same benchmark. The
  extent of the problem is unknown, as it is not straightforward to measure. Contamination
  causes an overestimation of the performance of a contaminated model in a target
  benchmark and associated task with respect to their non-contaminated counterparts.
  The consequences can be very harmful, with wrong scientific conclusions being published
  while other correct ones are discarded. This position paper defines different levels
  of data contamination and argues for a community effort, including the development
  of automatic and semi-automatic measures to detect when data from a benchmark was
  exposed to a model, and suggestions for flagging papers with conclusions that are
  compromised by data contamination.
