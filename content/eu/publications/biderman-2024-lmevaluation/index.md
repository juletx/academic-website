abstract: 'Effective evaluation of language models remains an open challenge in NLP.
  Researchers and engineers face methodological issues such as the sensitivity of
  models to evaluation setup, difficulty of proper comparisons across methods, and
  the lack of reproducibility and transparency. In this paper we draw on three years
  of experience in evaluating large language models to provide guidance and lessons
  for researchers. First, we provide an overview of common challenges faced in language
  model evaluation. Second, we delineate best practices for addressing or lessening
  the impact of these challenges on research. Third, we present the Language Model
  Evaluation Harness (lm-eval): an open source library for independent, reproducible,
  and extensible evaluation of language models that seeks to address these issues.
  We describe the features of the library as well as case studies in which the library
  has been used to alleviate these methodological concerns.'
