abstract: We present BabyBabelLM, a multilingual collection of datasets modeling the
  language a person observes from birth until they acquire a native language. We curate
  developmentally plausible pretraining data aiming to cover the equivalent of 100M
  English words of content in each of 45 languages. We compile evaluation suites and
  train baseline models in each language. BabyBabelLM aims to facilitate multilingual
  pretraining and cognitive modeling.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
